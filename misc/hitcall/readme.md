## Setup

If you dont have autoresponse permission yet, request for one from blarg admin by executing `.ar request <reason>`

Once granted, create autoresponse based on the keyword you want `.ar add /^[a-zA-Z\s1-9]+$/i -R` this will create a cc with the name like `_autoresponse_X`. Now then you can edit this newly created cc with whatever you want to do when someone type the matching keyword in the server
